1. Create a public repo
2. Using dotnet (any version), Selenium with local chrome driver, write     a scenario that:
       a. navigates to The Internet (the-internet.herokuapp.com)
        b. adds n number of elements
              c. asserts that n number of elements exist on the page
Bonus points if you can run it with GitHub actions and output a report
This is the task I got from the company
